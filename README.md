## Assessing Climate Change Vulnerability and Livelihood Strategies in Burkina Faso

**Data:**

* Survey data collected from 600 households in 9 villages across 3 climatic zones in Burkina Faso.
* Meteorological data from 3 stations covering the study area from 2001 to 2021.
* ACLED data on conflict events in Burkina Faso from 2012 to 2021.

**Methodology:**

* Calculated a Vulnerability Index (LVI) based on 9 dimensions: socio-demographic factors, livelihood strategies, social networks, food security, water security, health, land access, institutional factors, natural disasters, and climate variability.
* Used descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and regression analysis to analyze the data.

**Findings:**

* Found significant variations in vulnerability levels across the three climatic zones.
* Identified crop diversification, access to improved seeds, and community-based organizations as key adaptation strategies.
* Found a strong correlation between insecurity and vulnerability to climate change.

**Code:**

* The code is written in R and is organized into several scripts for data preprocessing, LVI calculation, and analysis.
* Dependencies: `tidyverse`, `coin`, `knitr`, `scale`, `kableExtra`, and other relevant packages.
